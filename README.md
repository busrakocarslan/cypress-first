## First, I added Cypress to my project using the yarn add command. Then, I ran Cypress with the npx cypress open command and opened its visual interface. By studying the Cypress documentation, I learned the basic commands and defined the necessary commands in the commands.js file to avoid code repetition in each test file. I also customized the cypress.config.js file with project-specific settings. By following these steps, I successfully completed the testing of my project. This was my first experience with writing tests, and I really enjoyed the process.
